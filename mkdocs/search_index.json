            "text": "Handling bars and instruments\n\n\nData is understood as information that is retrieved externally and uploaded to AgenaTrader, or as data series that are created by AgenaScripts.\n\n\nFurther detailed information can be found using the appropriate shortcuts:\n\n\nBars\n\n\nCollections\n\n\nData series\n\n\nInstruments\n\n\nMultibars\n\n\nBars\n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\nA classical indicator calculates one or multiple values using an existing data series.\n\n\nData series can be anything from closing prices to daily lows or values of an hourly period etc.\n\n\nEvery period (meaning all candles of one day, one hour etc.) is assigned one or more indicator values.\nThe following example is based on an indicator value, such as with a moving average, for example.\nTo calculate a smoothed moving average, AgenaTrader needs a data series. In this example we will use the closing prices. All closing prices of a bar (candle) that are represented in the chart will be saved in a list and indexed.\n\n\nThe current closing price, meaning the closing price of the bar that is on the right-hand side of the chart, will be assigned an index of 0. The bar to the left of that will have an index of 1 and so on. The oldest bar displayed will have an index value of 500.\n\n\nWhenever a new bar is added within a session it will become the new index 0; the bar to the left of it, which previously had an index of 0, will become index 1 and so on. The oldest bar will become index 501.\nWithin a script (a self-created program/algorithm) the \nClose\n will be representative for the array (list) of all closing prices.\nThe last closing price is thus \nClose [0]\n; the closing price previous to this will become \nClose [1]\n, the value before that will become \nClose [2]\n and the oldest bar will be \nClose [501]\n. The number within the squared brackets represents the index. AgenaTrader allows you to use the \u201ebars ago\" expression for this in general cases.\n\n\nObviously, every bar will not only have a closing value but also a \nHigh\n, \nLow\n, \nOpen\n, \nMedian\n, \nTypical\n, \nWeighted\n, \nTime\n and \nVolume\n. Thus, the high of the candle that occurred 10 days ago will be \nHigh [10]\n, yesterday\u2019s low \nLow [1]\n...\n\n\nImportant tip:\n\n\nThe previous examples all assume that the calculations will occur at the end of a period. The value of the currently running index is not being taken into consideration.\n\n\nIf you wish to use the values of the currently forming candle then you will need to set the value of\n\n\nCalculateOnClosedBar\n to \u201efalse\".\n\n\nIn this case the currently running bar will have the value 0, the bar next to the current bar will have the value 1 and so on. The oldest bar (as in the example above) would now have the value 502.\n\n\nWith close [0] you would receive the most recent value of the last price that your data provider transmitted to AgenaTrader. All values of the bar (high [0], low [0]\u2026) may still change as long as the bar is not yet finished/closed and a new bar has not yet started. Only the open [0] value will not change.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nProperties of Bars\n\n\n\"Bars\" represents a list of all bars (candles) within a chart (see \nFunctionality\n, \nBars\n).\n\n\nBars (\npublic\n IBars Bars) can be used directly in a script and equates to BarsArray [0] (see Bars.GetNextSessionTimeSpan for more information).\n\n\nThe list of bars itself has many properties that can be used in AgenaScript. Properties are always indicated by a dot before the objects (in this case bars, list of candles).\n\n\nBars.Count\n\n\nBars.CurrentSessionBeginTime\n\n\nBars.CurrentSessionEndTime\n\n\nBars.GetBar\n\n\nBars.GetBarIndex\n\n\nBars.GetBarsAgo\n\n\nBars.GetByIndex\n\n\nBars.GetClose\n\n\nBars.GetHigh\n\n\nBars.GetLow\n\n\nBars.GetNextSessionTimeSpan\n\n\nBars.GetOpen\n\n\nBars.GetSessionBegin\n\n\nBars.GetTime\n\n\nBars.GetVolume\n\n\nBars.Instrument\n\n\nBars.IsEod\n\n\nBars.IsFalling\n\n\nBars.IsFirstBarInSession\n\n\nBars.IsGrowing\n\n\nBars.IsIntraday\n\n\nBars.IsNtb\n\n\nBars.SessionBreak\n\n\nBars.LastBarCompleteness\n\n\nBars.NextSessionBeginTime\n\n\nBars.NextSessionEndTime\n\n\nBars.TailBottom\n\n\nBars.TailTop\n\n\nBars.TicksCountForLastBar\n\n\nBars.TicksCountInTotal\n\n\nBars.TimeFrame\n\n\nBarsCountForSession\n\n\nIsProcessingBarIndexLast\n\n\nWith the \nOnCalculate()\n method you can use any properties you want without having to test for a null reference.\nAs soon as the function \nOnCalculate()\n is called up by AgenaScript, it is assumed that an object is also available. If you wish to use these properties outside of \nOnCalculate()\n then you should first perform a test for null references using \nif\n (Bars != \nnull\n).\n\n\nBars.Count\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.Count gives you the amount of bars in a data series.\n\n\nSee \nProperties\n for additional information.\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType int Amount of Bars\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.Count\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nThe value of \nProcessingBarIndex\n can only be lesser than or equal to Bars.Count - 1\n\n\nWhen you specify how many bars are to be loaded within AgenaTrader, then the value of Bars.Count is equal to this setting. In the following example, Bars.Count would give back a value of 500.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nPrint (\"There are a total of\" + Bars.Count + \"bars available.\");\n\n\n\n\nBars.CurrentSessionBeginTime\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.CurrentSessionBeginTime outputs the date and time for the beginning of the current trading session.\n\n\nDate and time for the beginning of the current trading session will be displayed correctly when the function is used on a bar that has occurred in the past.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nNone\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType DateTime\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.GetSessionBegin\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nThe time for the returned value will equal the starting time defined in the Market Escort for the specified exchange. The value itself is set within the Instrument Escort and can be called up in AgenaScript using the function \nInstrument.Exchange\n .\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nPrint(\"The currently running trading session started at \" + Bars.CurrentSessionBeginTime );\n\n\n\n\nBars.CurrentSessionEndTime\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.CurrentSessionEndTime outputs the time for the end of the currently running trading session.\nDate and time for the end of the current trading session will, in this case, also be outputted correctly when the function is used on a previous bar.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nNone\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType DateTime\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.GetSessionEnd\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nThe time for the returned value will correlate with the end time of the trading session defined in the Market Escort for the exchange. The value itself can be set within the Instrument Escort and can be called up with AgenaScript using the \nInstrument.Exchange\n function.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nPrint(\"The current trading session will end at \" + Bars.CurrentSessionEndTime);\n\n\n\n\nBars.GetBar\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.GetBar outputs the first bars (from oldest to newest) that correspond to the specified date/time.\n\n\nSee \nBars.GetBarsAgo\n, \nBars.GetByIndex\n, \nBars.GetBarIndex\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType DateTime\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType IBar Bar Object, for the bars corresponding to the timestamp\n\n\nFor a timestamp older than the oldest bar: 0 (null)\nFor a timestamp younger than the newest bar: index of the last bar\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.GetBar(DateTime time)\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor the indexing of bars please see \nFunctionality\n, \nBars\n\n\nFor more information about using DateTime see \nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.datetime.aspx\n\n\nExample\n\n\nPrint (\"The closing price for 01.03.2012 at 18:00:00 was \" + Bars.GetBar(new DateTime(2012, 01, 03, 18, 0, 0)).Close);\n\n\n\n\nBars.GetBarIndex\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.GetBarIndex outputs the index of a bar \u2013 you can input either a bar object or a date-time object using this method.\n\n\nSee \nBars.GetBar\n, \nBars.GetBarsAgo\n, \nBars.GetByIndex\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType IBar bar\nor\nType DateTime\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType int The bar index of the specified bar object or DateTime object\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.GetBarIndex (IBar bar)\nBars.GetBarIndex (DateTime dt)\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor more information about indexing see \nFunctionality\n, \nBars\n\n\nExample\n\n\nint barsAgo = 5;\nIBar bar = Bars.GetBar(Time[barsAgo]);\nPrint(barsAgo + \" and \" + Bars.GetBarIndex(bar) + \" are equal in this example.\");\n\n\n\n\nBars.GetBarsAgo\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.GetBarsAgo outputs the index of the first bars (from oldest to newest) that correspond to the specified date/time.\n\n\nSee: \nBars.GetBar\n, \nBars.GetByIndex\n, \nBars.GetBarIndex\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType DateTime\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType int Index of the bar that corresponds to the timestamp\n\n\nWith a timestamp older than the oldest bar: 0 (null)\nWith a timestamp newer than the youngest bar: index of the last bar\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.GetBarsAgo(DateTime time)\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor more information about indexing please see \nFunctionality\n, \nBars\n\n\nFor more information about using DateTime see \nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.datetime.aspx\n\n\nExample\n\n\nPrint(\"The bar for 01.03.2012 at 18:00:00 O\u2019clock has an index of \" + Bars.GetBarsAgo(new DateTime(2012, 01, 03, 18, 0, 0)));\n\n\n\n\nBars.GetByIndex\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.GetByIndex outputs the index for the specified bar object\n\n\nSee \nBars.GetBar\n, \nBars.GetBarsAgo\n, \nBars.GetBarIndex\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType int Index\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nType IBar Bar object for the specified index\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nBars.GetByIndex (int Index)\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor indexing of bars see \nFunctionality\n, \nBars\n\n\nExample\n\n\nPrint(Close[0] + \" and \" + Bars.GetByIndex(ProcessingBarIndex).Close + \" are equal in this example.\");\n\n\n\n\nBars.GetClose\n\n\nBars.GetClose(int index) \u2013 see \nBars.GetOpen\n.\n\n\nBars.GetHigh\n\n\nBars.GetHigh(int index) \u2013 see \nBars.GetOpen\n.\n\n\nBars.GetLow\n\n\nBars.GetLow(int index) \u2013 see \nBars.GetOpen\n.\n\n\nBars.GetNextSessionTimeSpan\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nBars.GetNextSessionTimeSpan outputs the date and time for the beginning and end of a trading session.\n\n\nSee \nBars.CurrentSessionBeginTime\n, \nBars.CurrentSessionEndTime\n, \nBars.NextSessionBeginTime\n, \nBars.NextSessionEndTime\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDateTime\n\n\ntime\n\n\nDate or time for which the data of the following trading session will be scanned/searched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niBars\n\n\nbars\n\n\nBar object for which the data will be scanned/searched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nint\n\n\nbarsago\n\n\nNumber of days in the past for which the data will be searched/scanned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nDateTime session begin\nDateTime session end\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe date for the beginning and the end of a trading session are connected components.

A daily chart, on the other hand, would use the closing prices of the past 14 days in order to calculate this value.\nThe same method applies for your self-programmed indicators. A 5 minute chart will call up the \nOnCalculate()\n for each 5 minute bar.\nIf you want your self-created indicator to use a different timeframe, this is possible using multibars.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Xml;\nusing System.Xml.Serialization;\nusing AgenaTrader.API;\nusing AgenaTrader.Custom;\nusing AgenaTrader.Plugins;\nusing AgenaTrader.Helper;\nnamespace AgenaTrader.UserCode\n{\n    [Description(\"Multibar Demo\")]\n    // The indicator requires daily and weekly data\n    [TimeFrameRequirements(\"1 Day\", \"1 Week\")]\n    public class MultiBarDemo : UserIndicator\n    {\n        private static readonly TimeFrame TF_Day = new TimeFrame(DatafeedHistoryPeriodicity.Day, 1);\n        private static readonly TimeFrame TF_Week = new TimeFrame(DatafeedHistoryPeriodicity.Week, 1);\n\n        protected override void OnBarsRequirements()\n        {\n            Add(TF_Day);\n            Add(TF_Week);\n        }\n\n        protected override void OnInit()\n        {\n            CalculateOnClosedBar = true;\n        }\n        protected override void OnCalculate()\n        {\n            // The current value for the SMA 14 in the timeframe of the chart\n            Print(\"TF0: \" + SMA(Closes[0], 14)[0]);\n            // The current value for the SMA 14 in a daily timeframe\n            Print(\"TF1: \" + SMA(Closes[1], 14)[0]);\n            // Current value for the SMA 14 in a weekly timeframe\n            Print(\"TF2: \" + SMA(Closes[2], 14)[0]);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n\nWhen using additional timeframes, a further entry with the respective data series for the bars of the new timeframe will be added to the arrays \nOpens\n, \nHighs\n, \nLows\n, \nCloses\n, \nMedians\n, \nTypicals\n, \nWeighteds\n, \nTimes\n and \nVolumes\n. The indexing will occur in the order of the addition of the new timeframes.\nCloses[0][0] is equivalent to Close[0].\nCloses[1][0] equals the current closing price for the daily data series\nCloses[2][0] equals the current closing price for the weekly data series\n\n\n\"Closes\" is, of course, interchangeable with Opens, Highs, Lows etc.\n\n\nSee \nProcessingBarIndexes\n, \nProcessingBarSeriesIndex\n, \nTimeFrames\n, \nTimeFrameRequirements\n.\n\n\nAdditional syntax methods are available for multibars:\n\n\n// Declare the variable TF_DAY and define it\nprivate static readonly TimeFrame TF_Day = new TimeFrame(DatafeedHistoryPeriodicity.Day, 1);\nprivate static readonly TimeFrame TF_Week = new TimeFrame(DatafeedHistoryPeriodicity.Week, 1);\n// The following instruction is identical to double d = Closes[1][0];\ndouble d = MultiBars.GetBarsItem(TF_Day).Close[0];\n// The following instruction is identical to double w = Closes[2][0];\ndouble w = MultiBars.GetBarsItem(TF_Week).Close[0];\n\n\n\n\nProcessingBarIndexes\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nProcessingBarIndexes is an array of int values that contains the number of \nProcessingBarIndex\n for each bar.\n\n\nThis array is only of value for indicators or strategies that use data from multiple timeframes.\n\n\nA new entry is added to the array whenever a new timeframe is added to an indicator or strategy.\n\n\nWith \n[TimeFrameRequirements((\"1 Day\"), (\"1 Week\"))]\n the array will contain 3 entries:\n\n\nProcessingBarIndexes[0] Current bar for the primary data series (chart timeframe)\nProcessingBarIndexes[1] Current bar for the daily bars\nProcessingBarIndexes[2] Current bar for the weekly bars\n\n\nProcessingBarIndexes[0] is equivalent to \nProcessingBarIndex\n.\n\n\nAlso see \nMultiBars\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nbarSeriesIndex Index value for the various timeframes\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nProcessingBarIndexes[int barSeriesIndex]\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Ensure that a minimum of 20 bars is loaded\nfor (int i=0; i<ProcessingBarIndexes.Count; i++)\nif (ProcessingBarIndexes[i] < 20) return;\n\n\n\n\nProcessingBarSeriesIndex\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nWithin a multibars script, multiple bars objects are available. The OnCalculate() method\nwill therefore also be called up for every bar within your script. In order to include/exclude events of specific data series, you can use the ProcessingBarSeriesIndex property.\n\n\nProcessingBarSeriesIndex is only of value for indicators or strategies that use data from multiple timeframes.\nWith \n[TimeFrameRequirements(\"1 Day\", \"1 Week\")]\n two timeframes will be added to the primary chart timeframe.\n\n\nIf OnCalculate() is called up by the primary data series, then ProcessingBarSeriesIndex will equal zero. If OnCalculate() is called up by the daily bars, then ProcessingBarSeriesIndex will equal 1. Weekly bars will have a value of 2.\n\n\nSee \nMultibars\n and \nProcessingBarIndexes\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nnone\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nProcessingBarSeriesIndex\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nWithin a script that only works with primary timeframes, the value will always equal zero.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// To demonstrate the methodology\n// set CalculateOnClosedBar=false\nPrint(Time[0] + \" \" + ProcessingBarSeriesIndex);\n// Calculate only for the chart timeframe\nprotected override void OnCalculate()\n{\nif (ProcessingBarSeriesIndex > 0) return;\n// Logic for the primary data series\n}",

Data series can be anything from closing prices to daily lows or values of an hourly period etc.  Every period (meaning all candles of one day, one hour etc.) is assigned one or more indicator values.\nThe following example is based on an indicator value, such as with a moving average, for example.\nTo calculate a smoothed moving average, AgenaTrader needs a data series. In this example we will use the closing prices. All closing prices of a bar (candle) that are represented in the chart will be saved in a list and indexed.  The current closing price, meaning the closing price of the bar that is on the right-hand side of the chart, will be assigned an index of 0. The bar to the left of that will have an index of 1 and so on. The oldest bar displayed will have an index value of 500.  Whenever a new bar is added within a session it will become the new index 0; the bar to the left of it, which previously had an index of 0, will become index 1 and so on. The oldest bar will become index 501.\nWithin a script (a self-created program/algorithm) the  Close  will be representative for the array (list) of all closing prices.\nThe last closing price is thus  Close [0] ; the closing price previous to this will become  Close [1] , the value before that will become  Close [2]  and the oldest bar will be  Close [501] . The number within the squared brackets represents the index. AgenaTrader allows you to use the \u201ebars ago\" expression for this in general cases.  Obviously, every bar will not only have a closing value but also a  High ,  Low ,  Open ,  Median ,  Typical ,  Weighted ,  Time  and  Volume . Thus, the high of the candle that occurred 10 days ago will be  High [10] , yesterday\u2019s low  Low [1] ...  Important tip:  The previous examples all assume that the calculations will occur at the end of a period. The value of the currently running index is not being taken into consideration.  If you wish to use the values of the currently forming candle then you will need to set the value of  CalculateOnClosedBar  to \u201efalse\".  In this case the currently running bar will have the value 0, the bar next to the current bar will have the value 1 and so on. The oldest bar (as in the example above) would now have the value 502.  With close [0] you would receive the most recent value of the last price that your data provider transmitted to AgenaTrader. All values of the bar (high [0], low [0]\u2026) may still change as long as the bar is not yet finished/closed and a new bar has not yet started. Only the open [0] value will not change.",

It is guaranteed that this method will be called up in the correct order for the relevant events.\n\n\nImportant note:\n\n\nIf a strategy is to be controlled by order executions, we highly recommend that you use OnOrderExecution() instead of OnOrderChanged(). Otherwise there may be problems with partial executions.\n\n\nMore information can be found here: \nEvents\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nAn order object of the type IOrder\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nprotected override void OnOrderChanged(IOrder order)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprivate IOrder entry = null;\nprotected override void OnCalculate()\n{\n    if (CrossAbove(EMA(14), SMA(50), 1) && IsSerieRising(ADX(20)))\n        entry = OpenLong(\"EMACrossesSMA\");\n\n    if (entry != null && entry == order)\n    {\n        if (order.OrderState == OrderState.Filled)\n        {\n        PlaySound(\"OrderFilled.wav\");\n        entryOrder = null;\n        }\n    }\n}\nprotected override void OnOrderChanged(IOrder order)\n{\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnOrderExecution()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe OnOrderExecution() method is called up when an order is executed (filled).\nThe status of a strategy can be changed by a strategy-managed order. This status change can be initiated by the changing of a volume, price or the status of the exchange (from \u201cworking\u201d to \u201cfilled\u201d). It is guaranteed that this method will be called up in the correct order for all events.\n\n\nOnOrderExecution() will always be executed AFTER \nOnOrderChanged()\n.\n\n\nMore information can be found here: \nEvents\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nAn execution object of the type \nIExecution\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nprotected override void OnOrderExecution(IExecution execution)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprivate IOrder entry = null;\nprotected override void OnCalculate()\n{\n    if (CrossAbove(EMA(14), SMA(50), 1) && IsSerieRising(ADX(20)))\n            entry = OpenLong(\"EMACrossesSMA\");\n}\nprotected override void OnOrderExecution(IExecution execution)\n{\n    // Example\n    if (entry != null && execution.Order == entry)\n    {\n        Print(execution.Price.ToString());\n    Print(execution.Order.OrderState.ToString());\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnStart()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe OnStart() method can be overridden to initialize your own variables, perform license checks or call up user forms etc.\nOnStart() is only called up once at the beginning of the script, after \nOnInit()\n and before \nOnCalculate()\n are called up.\n\n\nSee \nOnDispose()\n.\n\n\nMore information can be found here: \nEvents\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nnone\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nprotected override void OnStart()\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprivate myForm Window;\nprotected override void OnStart()\n{\n    if (Chart != null)\n    {\n    Window = new myForm();\n    Window.Show();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnStop()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe OnStop() method is called up once a script is terminated. This can be when e.g. an indicator was removed from the chart or a column with an indicator / a scripted condition was removed from the scanner. \n\n\nSee \nOnDispose()\n.\n\n\nMore information can be found here: \nEvents\n.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nnone\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nprotected override void OnStop()\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprotected override void OnStop()\n{\n    Log(\"Stop: \" + this.ToString() + \" | \" + Instrument.Symbol, InfoLogLevel.Info); \n}",

Its purpose is to protect you from losses, and after reaching break-even, to protect your gains.\n\n\nThe order is sent directly to the broker and becomes effective immediately.\n\n\nIf the stop loss price and the offset value are static, you can define SetUpTrailStop() with the OnInit() method.\n\n\nIf you use SetUpTrailStop() within the \nOnCalculate()\n method, you must make sure that the parameters are readjusted to the initial value, otherwise the most recently used settings will be used for the new position.\n\n\nFunctionality:\n\n\nAssuming that you have SetUpTrailStop(CalculationMode.Ticks, 30) selected:\n\n\nIn a long position, the stop will be 30 ticks from the previously reached high. If the market makes a new high, the stop will be adjusted. However, the stop will no longer be moved downwards.\n\n\nIn a short position, this behavior starts with the most recent low.\n\n\nTips:\n\n\nIt is not possible to use SetUpStopLoss and SetUpTrailStop for the same position at the same time within one strategy. The SetUpStopLoss() method will always have precedence over the other methods.\n\n\nHowever, it is possible to use both variants parallel to each other in the same strategy if they are referencing different entry signals.\n\n\nPartial executions of a single order will cause a separate trading stop for each partial position.\n\n\nIf a SetUpProfitTarget() is used in addition to a SetUpTrailStop(), then both orders will be automatically linked to form an OCO order.\n\n\nIt is always a stop market order that is generated, and not a stop limit order.\n\n\nIf a position is closed by a different exit order within the strategy, then the TrailingStopOrder is automatically deleted.\n\n\nSee \nSetUpStopLoss()\n, \nSetUpProfitTarget()\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nSetUpTrailStop(double currency)\nSetUpTrailStop(double currency, bool simulated)\nSetUpTrailStop(CalculationMode mode, double value)\nSetUpTrailStop(string fromEntry signal, CalculationMode mode, double value, bool simulated)\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurrency\n\n\nThe distance between the stop loss and the entry price\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\nPossible values are:   CalculationMode.Percent; CalculationMode.Ticks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsimulated\n\n\nWhen set to \"true,\" the stop order does not go live (as a market order) until the price has \u201etouched\" it for the first time (meaning that it is executed just as it would be under real market conditions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\n\n\nThe distance between stop price and profit target.

The order is sent directly to the broker and becomes effective immediately.  If the stop loss price and the offset value are static, you can define SetUpTrailStop() with the OnInit() method.  If you use SetUpTrailStop() within the  OnCalculate()  method, you must make sure that the parameters are readjusted to the initial value, otherwise the most recently used settings will be used for the new position.  Functionality:  Assuming that you have SetUpTrailStop(CalculationMode.Ticks, 30) selected:  In a long position, the stop will be 30 ticks from the previously reached high. If the market makes a new high, the stop will be adjusted. However, the stop will no longer be moved downwards.  In a short position, this behavior starts with the most recent low.  Tips:  It is not possible to use SetUpStopLoss and SetUpTrailStop for the same position at the same time within one strategy. The SetUpStopLoss() method will always have precedence over the other methods.  However, it is possible to use both variants parallel to each other in the same strategy if they are referencing different entry signals.  Partial executions of a single order will cause a separate trading stop for each partial position.  If a SetUpProfitTarget() is used in addition to a SetUpTrailStop(), then both orders will be automatically linked to form an OCO order.  It is always a stop market order that is generated, and not a stop limit order.  If a position is closed by a different exit order within the strategy, then the TrailingStopOrder is automatically deleted.  See  SetUpStopLoss() ,  SetUpProfitTarget() .",

Within AgenaScript, indicators, and strategies, you can use these attributes in the same manner as you would in C#.\nInformation regarding the usage of attributes can be found here:\n\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/z0w1kczw%28v=vs.80%29.aspx\n\n\nThe most commonly used attributes in AgenaScript are:\n\n\n\n\nBrowsable\n\n\nCategory\n\n\nConditionalValue\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDisplayName\n\n\nTimeFrameRequirements\n\n\nXmlIgnore\n\n\n\n\nBrowsable\n\n\nBrowsable is an \nAttribute\n within AgenaScript.\n\n\nAgenaScript uses public variables for entering parameters for indicators (such as periods for the SMA) and for outputting events and calculations within indicators (for example, data series).\nVariables used for entering parameters must be displayed in the properties dialog. Data series are exempt from this.\nPublic variables with the browsable attribute set to false are not displayed within the properties dialog.\n\n\nBy default, browsable is set to true. Therefore, within a variable containing an entry parameter, the attribute does not need to be specified.\n\n\nExample for a parameter:\n\n\nThe parameter should be displayed and queried in the properties window. Therefore browsable should be set to true.\n\n\n[Description(\"Numbers of bars used for calculations\")]\n[Category(\"InputParameter\")]\npublic int Period\n{\nget { return period; }\nset { period = Math.Max(1, value); }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample for a data series:\n\n\n[Browsable(false)]\n[DisplayName(\"Lower band\")]\n[XmlIgnore]\npublic DataSeries Lower\n{\nget { return Outputs[0]; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n\nCategory is an \nAttribute\n in AgenaScript and can be used on properties and classes.\n\n\nThe category attribute on properties defines under which category in the properties dialog the parameter is shown.\nIf this attribute is missing, the parameters category is accepted as the standard.\n\n\nThe following example shows how to create the new category \"My InputParameter\" in the properties dialog:\n\n\n[Category(\"My InputParameter\")]\n[DisplayName(\"Period number\")]\npublic double _period\n{\nget { return _period; }\nset { _period = value; }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the category \nAttribute\n on classes you are able to create subcategories for your scripts and group them all in one category.\nThis is pretty useful if you are creating a package and you want to group a few indicators in a group with one name.\n\n\nThe following example shows how to create a subfolder \"My Package\":\n\n\nnamespace AgenaTrader.UserCode\n{\n    [Description(\"Description what this indicator doing.\")]\n    [Category(\"My Package\")]\n    public class MyHolyGrail_Indicator : UserIndicator\n    {\n      /* your code here */\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nConditionalValue\n\n\nConditional value is an \nAttribute\n in AgenaScript.\n\n\nNormally, when making comparisons within the ConditionEscort, the data series generated by indicators are used. One such example would be checking whether a moving average lies above or below a specific price value.\nAn indicator can also yield values that are not contained within data series, such as values of the type int, double, char, Boolean, string, etc.\nTo use these values within the scanner or ConditionEscort, they have to be labeled with the conditional value attribute.\n\n\n[Browsable(false)]\n[XmlIgnore]\n[ConditionalValue]\npublic int PublicVariable\n{\nget\n{\nUpdate();\nreturn _internVariable;\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nDescription is an \nAttribute\n in AgenaScript.\n\n\nThe description attribute is used in AgenaScript for classes and public variables.\nAs an attribute of the class, the text is a description of the function of the entire indicator.\n\n\n[Description(\"Displays the tick count of a bar.\")]\npublic class TickCounter : UserIndicator\n{\n//As an attribute of a public variable, the text is a description of the function of the parameter.\n[Description(\"Number of standard deviations\")]\n[DisplayName(\"# of std. dev.\")]\npublic double NumStdDev\n{\nget { return numStdDev; }\nset { numStdDev = Math.Max(0, value); }\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe descriptions are displayed in the relevant properties dialog.\n\n\nDisplayName\n\n\nDisplay name is an \nAttribute\n in AgenaScript.\n\n\nThe display name attribute defines the text shown in the properties dialog for the parameter.\n\n\nIf this attribute is not specified, the name of the public variable is used.\n\n\n[Description(\"Number of standard deviations\")]\n[DisplayName(\"# of std. dev.\")]\npublic double NumStdDev\n{\nget { return numStdDev; }\nset { numStdDev = Math.Max(0, value); }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTimeFrameRequirements\n\n\nTimeframe requirements is an \nAttribute\n in AgenaScripts.\n\n\nIf you want a script to use data from various timeframes, the class requires the attribute \u201eTimeFrameRequirements\". You can specify multiple timeframes here:\n\n\n[TimeFrameRequirements(\"1 day\")]\n[TimeFrameRequirements(\"15 minutes\", \"1 day\", \"1 week\")]\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of data provided for the other timeframes will always be the same as the number of actual candles loaded into the chart. If there are 500 candles for a 5-minute chart, then 500 candles of another timeframe will also be loaded. In the first example above, 500 daily candles will be loaded. In the second example, 500 15-minute candles, 500 daily candles and 500 weekly candles will be loaded.\nThe amount of data can become rather large very quickly, thus you should take precautions when using this attribute.\n\n\nSee \nMultiBars\n.\n\n\nImportant:\n\n\nIf a class uses a different indicator that requires one or more secondary timeframes, then the \"TimeFrameRequirements\" attribute must be set for the class retrieving the data. An example for this can be seen here: \nGetDayBar\n.\n\n\nXMLIgnore\n\n\nXML ignore is an \nAttribute\n in AgenaScript.\n\n\nAgenaTrader saves all parameter settings for the indicators in a template. The template files are saved in an XML format. In order to avoid a parameter being saved as part of the template, the attribute XML ignore can be set.\n\n\nTo save parameters in an XML file, the values must be serialized. Under most circumstances, AgenaTrader performs this automatically. Self-defined data types cannot be serialized automatically, so in this case the programmer is responsible for the correct serialization.\nIn the following example, the color and font are used as parameters of an indicator. AgenaTrader has two methods for serializing color and font information (TextColorSerialize and TextFontSerialize). Both parameters \u2013 TextColor and TextFont \u2013 thus need to be marked with the XML ignore parameter.\n\n\nprivate Color _textColor = Color.Blue;\nprivate Font _textFont = new Font(\"Arial\", 12, FontStyle.Bold);\n[XmlIgnore]\n[Description(\"Textcolor\")]\npublic Color TextColor\n{\nget { return _textColor; }\nset { _textColor = value; }\n}\n[Browsable(false)]\npublic string TextColorSerialize\n{\nget { return SerializableColor.ToString(_textColor); }\nset { _textColor = SerializableColor.FromString(value); }\n}\n[XmlIgnore()]\n[Description(\"TextFont\")]\npublic Font TextFont\n{\nget { return _textFont; }\nset { _textFont = value; }\n}\n[Browsable(false)]\npublic string TextFontSerialize\n{\nget { return SerializableFont.ToString(_textFont); }\nset { _textFont = SerializableFont.FromString(value); }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCalculateOnClosedBar\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe property \"CalculateOnClosedBar\" determines the events for which AgenaTrader can call up the OnCalculate() method.\n\n\nCalculateOnClosedBar = true\n\n\n\n\nOnCalculate()\n is called up when a bar is closed and the next incoming tick creates a new bar.\n\n\nCalculateOnClosedBar = false\n\n\n\n\nOnCalculate() is called up for each new incoming tick.\nIf you are running AgenaTrader on older hardware, this may cause performance issues with instruments that are highly liquid.\nThe property can be queried in the script and will return a value of the type Boolean (true or false).\nCalculateOnClosedBar can be used within OnInit() and also within OnCalculate().\nOnCalculate is only called up for the closing price of each bar with historical data, even if CalculateOnClosedBar is set to false.\nWhen an indicator is called up by another indicator, the CalculateOnClosedBar property of the retrieved indicator overwrites the indicator performing the retrieving.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nCalculateOnClosedBar\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nSee \nBars\n.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprotected override void OnInit()\n{\n//Indicator calculation should only occur when a bar has closed/finished\nCalculateOnClosedBar = true;\n}\n\n\n\n\nChart\n\n\nChart control is an object that provides reading access of various properties for the chart.\n\n\nThe important properties are:\n\n\n\n\nChartFontColor, BackColor\n\n\nUpColor, DownColor\n\n\nFont\n\n\nBarMarginLeft, BarMarginRight\n\n\nBarSpace, BarWidth\n\n\nBarsPainted\n\n\nFirstBarPainted, LastBarPainted\n\n\nBarsVisible\n\n\nFirstBarVisible, LastBarVisible\n\n\nGetXByBarIdx, GetYByValue\n\n\n\n\nAn example can be seen here: \nPlotSample\n.\n\n\nBarsPainted und BarsVisible:\n\n\nBarsPainted contains the number of bars that a chart \ncould\n display from the left to right border with the current width and distance of the candles.\nBarsVisible contains the number of bars actually visible.\n\n\nFirstBarPainted und FirstBarVisible:\n\n\nFirstBarPainted contains the number of the bar that \nwould\n be displayed on the left border of the chart.\n\n\nFirstBarVisible contains the number of the bar that is actually shown as the first bar on the left side of the chart area.\n\n\nExample: the chart has been moved so that the first bar of the chart is now in the middle of the chart.\n\n\nFirstBarPainted would be negative.\n\n\nFirstBarVisible would be 0.\n\n\nLastBarPainted und LastBarVisible:\n\n\nLastBarPainted contains the number of the bar that \nwould\n be displayed on the right border of the chart.\n\n\nLastBarVisible contains the number of the bar that is actually displayed on the right side of the chart.\n\n\nExample: the chart has been moved so that the last bar of the chart is displayed in the middle section.\n\n\nLastBarPainted would be larger than Bars.Count.\n\n\nLastBarVisible would be Bars.Count -1.\n\n\nClearTraceWindow()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe ClearTraceWindow() method empties the output window.

For example, when calculating the smoothing average, each bar is assigned the value calculated for this bar.\nA data series is an array that contains as many elements as there are bars displayed in a chart. AgenaTrader ensures that data series are correctly synchronized with the bars.\nData series are used in exactly the same way as the close or time series. They can therefore also be used for the input data for various indicators.\nIn the table below you will find 4 newly created data series (highlighted). Each data series has exactly one value of a special data type (int, bool, string) attached to it per bar. The indexing with barsAgo is thus identical to the data series provided by the system.\n\n\n\n\nUsable Data Series in AgenaTrader\n\n\nBoolSeries\n\n\nDataSeries\n\n\nDateTimeSeries\n\n\nFloatSeries\n\n\nIntSeries\n\n\nLongSeries\n\n\nStringSeries\n\n\nIn addition, there are also data series such as ColorSeries, although these are only used for internal purposes and should not be used directly.\nTo change the color of plots, please use \nPlotColors\n.\n\n\nSet(), Reset() und ContainsValue()\n\n\nEach data series contains a \nSet()\n, \nReset()\n and \nContainsValue()\n method.\nWith Set(value) or Set(int barsAgo, value) you can place values into the data series for the current position, or in this case into the barsAgo position.\nWith Reset() or Reset(int barsAgo) you can delete a value from the data series for the current position or for the barsAgo position.

If a chart contains 500 bars and an indicator is to be calculated on the basis of these, then AgenaTrader will begin calculating from the oldest bar. The oldest bar receives the number 0. Once the calculation for this bar has been completed, the OnCalculate() method is called up for the next bar, which in turn receives the number 1. This continues until the last bar, which receives a value of 500.\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nnone\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nCurrent bar is a variable of the type int, which always contains the number of the bar currently being used.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nProcessingBarIndex\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nThe OnCalculate() method uses numbering different from that of ProcessingBarIndex in terms of the \nBarindex\n and \nBars\n. Understanding this difference is of great importance, which is why we ask you to please read the following paragraph carefully:\n\n\nProcessingBarIndex numbers continuously from the oldest to youngest bar starting with 0. The BarIndex for the youngest bar is always 0. In the example referenced below this paragraph, Time[0] stands for the timestamp of the current bar. The index of the oldest bar always has 1 added to it. Thus a logical numbering of barsAgo is possible. The timestamp for the bar of 5 periods ago is Time[5].\nFor using multiple timeframes (multi-bars) in an indicator, see ProcessingBarIndexes.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprotected override void OnCalculate()\n{\nPrint(\"Call of OnCalculate for bar nr. \" + ProcessingBarIndex + \" of \" + Time[0]);\n}\n\n\n\n\nRemoveChartDrawing()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe RemoveChartDrawing() method removes a specific drawing object from the chart based on a unique identifier (tag).\nSee \nRemoveChartDrawings()\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRemoveChartDrawings(string tag)\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nnone\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nstring tag The clearly identifiable name for the drawing object\n\n\nExample\n\n\nRemoveChartDrawings(\"My line\");\n\n\n\n\nRemoveChartDrawings()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method removes all drawings from the chart\nSee \nRemoveChartDrawings()\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRemoveChartDrawings()\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nnone\n\n\nExample\n\n\n//Delete all drawings from the chart\nRemoveChartDrawings();\n\n\n\n\nRequiredBarsCount\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe property \"RequiredBarsCount\" determines how many historical bars are required for an indicator or a strategy to call up the OnCalculate() method for the first time and thus begin the calculations. Bars required should be set within the OnInit() method.\nThe setting should be chosen carefully. If you require 100 days for the calculation of a moving average, then you should ensure that at least 100 days of historical data are loaded.\nThe property can be queried in the script and will return an int value.\n\n\nWhen OnCalculate is called up for the first time, the ProcessingBarIndex property is 0 regardless of the value of RequiredBarsCount.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nRequiredBarsCount\n\n\nExample\n\n\nprotected override void OnInit()\n{\n//The indicator requires a minimum of 50 bars loaded into the history\nRequiredBarsCount = 50;\n}\n\n\n\n\nShowAlert()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe ShowAlert method creates an acoustic and/or visual alarm.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nShowAlert(string message, bool showMessageBox, string soundLocation);\n//Due to compatability reasons, an old signature is still used here. When using this method, the color settings and the \"re-arm seconds\" parameter are ignored.\nShowAlert(string id, AlertPriority priority, string message, string soundLocation, int rearmSeconds, Color backColor, Color forColor);\n\n\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nNone\n\n\nParameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n\n\nAlert text displayed within the messages tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsoundLocation\n\n\nName of a sound file in the *.wav format. If no path is specified, then \"My Documents\\AgenaTrader\\Sounds\\ is used\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshowMessageBox\n\n\nIf set to \"true\", a message box will be displayed in addition to the sound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n// Message will be outputted if the SMA(20) crosses below the SMA(50)\nif (CrossBelow(SMA(20), SMA(50), 1))\nAlert(\"Check short signal!\", true, \"Alert4.wav\");\n\n\n\n\nTo use music files in a different path, you need to specify the path:\n\n\nstring pathOfSoundfile = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments)+@\"\\\\MyAlertSounds\\\\\";\nstring nameOfSoundFile = \"MyAlertSoundFile.wav\";\nAlert(\"Message text\", true, pathOfSoundfile + nameOfSoundFile);\n\n\n\n\nTickSize\n\n\nA tick is the smallest possible price change of a financial instrument within an exchange. If, for example, the trading prices are specified to 2 decimal places, then a tick equals 0.01. You can expect Forex instruments to be specified to within 4 or 5 decimal places. A tick is called a pip in Forex trading and usually equals 0.0001 or 0.00001.\nThe tick value is usually predefined by the exchange and does not (usually) change.\nSee \nInstrument.TickSize\n.\n\n\nUsually, a tick is displayed as a decimal number. Historically speaking (especially in American exchanges) stocks have been noted with tick sizes of 1/16 of a dollar.\nThis notation is still widespread within commodities. Corn futures (ZC) are noted in \u00bc US cents/bushel (usually equals 12.50 US$ per contract).\nUS treasury bonds are noted in a tick size of 1/32 points, which equals 31.25$.\nNotations are usually made with apostrophes, for example:\n\n\n149'00 equals exactly 149,\n149'01 equals 149 1/32 (meaning 149.03125),\n149'31 equals 149 31/32 (149.96875),\nand the next value after this is 150\u201900\n\n\nIn the so-called T-Bond intermonth spreads, notations are specified in quarters of 1/32, resulting in point values of 7.8125 per contract.\n\n\nNotations have a dash:\n\n\n17-24 equals 17 24/32 points,\n17-242 equals 17 24.25/32 points,\n17-245 equals 17 24.5/32 points and\n17-247 equals 17 24.75/32 points.\nThe next notation after 17-247 is 17-25 and then 17-252, 17-255 etc.\nAfter 17-317 comes 18.\n\n\nThe individual contract specifications can be found on the websites of the respective exchanges.\n\n\nCME: \nhttp://www.cmegroup.com\n under Products & Trading\nEurex (FDAX): \nhttp://www.eurexchange.com/exchange-en/products/idx/dax/17206/\n\n\nSee \nInstrument.TickSize\n.\n\n\nTimeFrame\n\n\nSee \nBars.TimeFrame\n.\n\n\nWhen using multiple timeframes (\nMultibars\n) in an indicator, please see \nTimeFrames\n.\n\n\nUpdate()\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe Update() method calls up the OnCalculate method in order to recalculate the indicator values.\n\n\nUpdate() is to be used with caution and is intended for use by experienced programmers.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nUpdate()\n\n\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nnone\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nnone\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe effect of update can be illustrated with the help of 2 indicators.\nThe first indicator, Ind1, uses a public variable from the indicator Ind2.\n\n\nCode from Ind1:\n\n\npublic class Ind1 : UserIndicator\n{\nprotected override void OnCalculate()\n{\nPrint( Ind2().MyPublicVariable );\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode from Ind2:\n\n\nprivate double myPublicVariable = 0;\nprotected override void OnCalculate()\n{\nmyPublicVariable = 1;\n}\npublic double MyPublicVariable\n{\nget\n{\nUpdate();\nreturn myPublicVariable;\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nWithout Update() - Wrong\n\nIf Ind2 is called up by Ind1, the get-method of MyPublicVariable is called up in Ind2. Without Update(), the value of MyPublicVariable would be returned. In this case it would be 0.\n\n\nWith Update() - Correct\n\nBy calling up Update(), OnCalculate() is initially executed by Ind2. This sets MyPublicVariable to 1. Lastly, the value 1 is passed on to the requesting indicator.\n\n\nValue\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nValue is a data series object containing the first data series of an indicator.\n\n\nWhen the Add() method is called up, a value object is automatically created and added to the values collection.\n\n\nValue is identical to Values[0].\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nValue\n\n\nValue[\nint\n barsAgo]\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nThe methods known for a collection, Set(), Reset(), and Count(), can be used for values.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nSee \nValues\n.",

AgenaTrader ensures that data series are correctly synchronized with the bars.\nData series are used in exactly the same way as the close or time series. They can therefore also be used for the input data for various indicators.\nIn the table below you will find 4 newly created data series (highlighted).

A tick is called a pip in Forex trading and usually equals 0.0001 or 0.00001.\nThe tick value is usually predefined by the exchange and does not (usually) change.\nSee  Instrument.TickSize .  Usually, a tick is displayed as a decimal number. Historically speaking (especially in American exchanges) stocks have been noted with tick sizes of 1/16 of a dollar.\nThis notation is still widespread within commodities. Corn futures (ZC) are noted in \u00bc US cents/bushel (usually equals 12.50 US$ per contract).\nUS treasury bonds are noted in a tick size of 1/32 points, which equals 31.25$.\nNotations are usually made with apostrophes, for example:  149'00 equals exactly 149,\n149'01 equals 149 1/32 (meaning 149.03125),\n149'31 equals 149 31/32 (149.96875),\nand the next value after this is 150\u201900  In the so-called T-Bond intermonth spreads, notations are specified in quarters of 1/32, resulting in point values of 7.8125 per contract.  Notations have a dash:  17-24 equals 17 24/32 points,\n17-242 equals 17 24.25/32 points,\n17-245 equals 17 24.5/32 points and\n17-247 equals 17 24.75/32 points.\nThe next notation after 17-247 is 17-25 and then 17-252, 17-255 etc.\nAfter 17-317 comes 18.
